## Inspiration

I would highly suggest all of you to take a look at this wonderful repo which served as the inspiration for my project.

## Drawback of approach
	
The drawback of the approach taken by <a href="https://github.com/jomariya23156" target="_blank" rel=”noreferrer”>jomariya23156</a> is that although he claims that it is a web app it cannot be used in a server-client scenario as it lacks basic webrtc features.

## Project Limitations
- can run on only 3-4 devices at a time.
- doesn't work well in bright background light.
- performance varies from browser to browser: Works fast on Chrome and Firefox but is slow on Edge.


# That's all folks!
